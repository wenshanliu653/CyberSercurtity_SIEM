### CyberSercrity Bootcamp Capstone <br>
This is the final capstone project in bootcamp course.  In this capstone project, we applied what we had learned from the program to design monitoring systems for an
organization. For this purpose, we will be using Wazuh as the SIEM system. Wazuh Security Information and
Event Management (SIEM) solution provides monitoring, detection, and alerting of security events and incidents.
Wazuh has created an entirely new cloud-based architecture to reduce complexity and improve security while
providing stronger endpoint protection. <br>


This study explains the utilization of SIEM for the purpose of identifying suspicious applications and monitoring malicious network connections. It has a chance to be utilized in various areas. It offers an effective method to prevent data breaches or significant cyber-crimes in the real world. This project demonstrates the process of deploying the Wazuh system on the designated machine and monitoring the server. Furthermore, it illustrates the process of conducting an experiment to identify the failure of a login attempt in order to operate the system and uncover any potentially dangerous applications. Lastly, the process of integrating data from logs and generating a report can be learned through the utilization of the visualization function. <br>
